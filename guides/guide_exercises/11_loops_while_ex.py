# Coding Exercise
# In the below starter code, place 4 dog names (elements) of your choice in the dog_house list. Then write a while loop that iterates through the dog_house list and prints each dogs name. An iterator variable named "counter" must be set, and must have an initial value of 0.

# Hint: An iterator value (also sometimes called a sentinel value) is a value that exists outside of your loop, and that you update or otherwise keep track of each time you loop, so that your while loop knows when to end.

# Example:
# iterator_value = 0
# while iterator_value < 10:
#     print("Keep looping...")
#     iterator_value += 1

dog_house = ['Tom', 'Jerry', 'Mickey', 'Minnie']

counter = 0
while counter < 4:
    print(dog_house[counter])
    counter += 1
